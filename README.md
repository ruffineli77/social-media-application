# CRUD: General Social Media Site

Everyone does a to do list for this. How can we include all features in one website?

## Basic Plan

- Users create an account with an email, add a username, profile picture, bio, subscribe to tags/communities, get suggestions based on likes and viewed content.  
- Registered users upload short quotes or paragraphs, links to websites, pictures, videos, and captions. Others can like, comment, re-post, share.
- Asynchronous messaging or web sockets. Include notifications, reminders.
- Friend/follow system that fills a home page with content uploaded by others.
- Explore page specific to each user based on their likes and viewing habits.
- Tik-tok like infinite scrolling page.
- User page where all posts, comments, and likes can be viewed. Include privacy settings such as invisible mode, friends mode, public mode.

For version 1 each feature will have its own route. Some modals on IG open on the left and minimize the nav bar further left.

Consider how using template inheritance can reduce the number of routes/pages.

The application is centered around the content uploaded so the class and id names will reflect that.

Some features don't need to be flex rows, float left and right will work well.

## Elements/Features

## Separate Page Features

### Home

### Messages

- Like, copy and report messages by double clicking on mobile or clicking the three dot image.

## Side Navbar Features

These features are found on the left sidebar. When clicked they minimize the nav icons and replace the center area with their own content. They include from top to bottom: home, search, explore, new post, messages, notifications, profile. At the bottom the stacked bar icon opens a second menu with lesser used features like setting, your activity, your profile QR code, saved posts, and close friends. 

### Search

## Modal Features

These features all include a close button. It makes returning to where you were while browsing much easier. Each modal should use the same basic styling
